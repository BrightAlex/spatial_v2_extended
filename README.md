# spatial_v2_extended

Extensions include:
* Extensions of most algorithms (RNEA, ABA, CRBA, etc.) to address dynamic effects from motor rotors
* Updated most algorithms (RNEA, ABA, CRBA, etc.) to handle multi-DoF joints (e.g., spherical or floating base) without needing specialized versions
* New algorithms to compute the Coriolis matrix [all systems] and Christoffel symbols [Single DoF joints only]
* Regressor calculation algorithms
* Algorithms for assessing identifiability
* Variety of tools for converting between different representations of orientation
